# **Law Firm Customer Records Sorting**

## **Overview**
A law firm manages customer records containing:
- `customer_id`, `date_of_birth` (DOB), and `last_visit_date`
- Other metadata (e.g., name, case details)

### **Objective**
Implement quicksort to sort customer records:
- By **date_of_birth** in ascending order
- By **last_visit_date** in descending order

---

## **Features**
- Efficient sorting using the QuickSort algorithm.
- Flexible sorting options based on key attributes (`DOB` or `last_visit_date`).
- Handles large datasets typical in legal contexts.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To work with this project, you will need:
- Basic knowledge of Python (or pseudocode understanding).
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
- Git installed on your system.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd law-firm-sorting
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Sorting Options**
The program allows sorting of customer records by:
1. **Date of Birth (Ascending)**  
2. **Last Visit Date (Descending)**  

Modify the `sort_key` parameter in the code to choose the sorting criteria.
